As input, you are given the coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2, and Y2. Create a function
that prints the point closest to the coordinate system's centre (0, 0) in the format (X, Y). Print only the first one if the points are at the same distance from the centre.

Sample input: 3 2 7 8

Sample output: (3, 2)
